# Demo
This demo consists of 2 files:

`singleball.py` - Bounces a ball around the screen, changing colour with each bounce at the boundaries of the screen. Behaves similarly to the idle screen on old DVD players.

`multiball.py` - The same as the `singleball.py` file, but will generate multiple balls instead

This demo taught me some basic collision math
