# Demo
This demo shows a circle in the centre of the screen, with a smaller circle moving across the X axis, overlapping. Each circle progressively gets larger, until it reaches a maximum, where it starts over.

This demo taught me some very basics of Picographics, how to move a 2D object on a single axis, along with how to clear it up without performing a full display clear.
